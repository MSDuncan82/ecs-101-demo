# ecs-101-demo

This is a small demo application for an ECS 101 talk I'm giving @ AWSMeetupGroup.

The demo application code resides in `app/` and was originally copied from [awesome-compose](https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose), specifically the [React, Express, Mongo example](https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose/tree/master/react-express-mongodb). It has been slightly adapted for this example.

The deploy code for this example has been written in Terraform and resides in `terraform/`.
